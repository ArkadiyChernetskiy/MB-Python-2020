    "As always lets begin from what we spoke about previous lecture. A Graph is container that contain two sets - vertices `V` and edges `E`. First one some data nodes and second one the 'pair' of such vertices with some data too.\n",

    "![WeightGraph](images/11-18/weightGraph.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, each edge connect some pair of vertex. And how you can notice at previous lecture we can reach one vertex from other through many different ways. Let's imagine some district where we should create a minimum possible cost road network. First of all there should be no cycle - the path through vertices without repeating of edges from one vertex to it back. For example at graph below from vertex 3 you can move throw 2->1->0->3 without repeating. And if there is some cycle than we can delete minimum one edge and stay all points inside district attainable. In result we can reduce the cost by deleting one edge.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ok, how we previously discuss, we can calculate such tree with greedy algorithm. Lets remember how it work. The Greedy algorithm is some special mechanics of creating solution for optimization task. To prove that it can work we should create matroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matroids is the pair `(S,I)`, where `S` - our set `X` and `I` the set of subsets with some special properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Empty subset from `S` is element(set is element!) of `I`\n",

    "\n",
    "In our situation `S` - the set of all edges. `I` - set of sets of edges with size less than |V|-1 - size of V minus one without cycles. The all sets of edges with such sizes (|V| - 1) will be Base tree edges set. Lets go:\n",
    " \n",
    "- empty set of edges is the part of `I`.\n",
    "- Subset of edges `A` that is subset of `B` and `B` is element of `I` mean that |B| < |V| and |A|<|B|<|V| -> |A| < |V|. Plus to this because `B` has no cycles that is mean subset of edges `B` has no cycles too. That mean that `A` is element from `I`.\n",
    "- |A|<|B|. Lets take `e` from set `B\\A` and add `e` to `A`. First of all new set, lets call it `С` become no bigger than `B` because `A` is less than `B` and one edge give the `A` only +1 to size. Now the main point - we should check if there is an `e` that not create a cycle inside `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, there is always some `e` inside `B\\A` because |B| > |A| and even if `A` and `B` completely match there is some edge from `B` that is not in `A`. Lets assume that there are no any edges from `B\\A` that can complete `A` without cycle. And lets than check how `B` looks like. \n",
    " \n",
    "If there is no any edges that can complete `A` without cycles than all edges inside `B\\A` connects vertices from `A` mean any edge from `B\\A` connects the same vertices that connects all edges inside `A`. Of course `A` can be divided into trees because not all sets can be connect with each other. But because we not found the edge without cycle mean each edge from `B` connect vertices inside subtrees of `A`. So lets image for simplify that all vertices in `A` is connected into one tree.\n",
    " \n",
    "Lets call such set of vertices from `A` `Va`. Edges from `B\\A` connects vertices from `Va` too. In sum we have |A| + n edges that connects `Va` vertices. Because `A` has no cycles it connects |A| + 1 vertices -> `|Va|` = |A| + 1. That is mean that `B` connect |A| + 1 vertices. But because |A| < |B| and |B| >= |A| + 1 there is one or more edges, that connect already connected vertices. But it is impossible because `B` is part of `I` and that is mean that in `B` cannot be any cycles.\n",
    " \n",
    "Important point - to connect 2 vertices you need 1 edge, to connect 3 vertices you need connect previous 2 vertices with one edge and connect to then the third vertex with second edge, to connect 4 vertices our need connect previous 3 vertices and the fourth vertex with third edge and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In final we approve that we can use greedy algorithm to create a Minimal Base Tree. Now we can think how we can use it. As we plan our matroids we can move from one tree with N vertices to tree with N+1 vertices at each step adding the edge with minimal cost. The main problem is check if the new edge will create a cycle or not. And there are 3 most common solutions of this problem that divides into 3 algorithms: `Kruskal's algorithm`; `Prim's algorithm`; `Borůvka's algorithm`. In this lecture we will speak `only` about `Kruskal` and `Prim`.\n",

    "So, at each step when we add edge with vertex into our tree we add into the heap all edges from new vertex to vertices that is not currently inside our tree. In such way inside the heap we will care all edges that connect our tree to vertices inside the tree and free vertices outside tree. So, then in next step we take from the heap edge with minimal weight and check: \n",

    "- 1) if it connect 2 vertices from the tree than we just forgot about it and take the next edge. \n",

    "- Than at each step we add the edges into the heap ~ O(log|E|) for each edge and get some to find the next edge for adding ~ O(log|E|). In sum we add near all edges from the original graph. So, it takes about `O(|E|log|E|)` steps. Actually there is some optimizations that can help a little speed up the algorithm (with fibonachi heap) but we will omit it."

Than each vertex will has some color and if they already connected with some way than they will be colored in one color.
